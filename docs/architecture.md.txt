Healthcare insurance analysis platform

Functionality and Structure:

The project's core functionality revolves around the ingestion, transformation, and analysis of diverse datasets, including patient demographics, accident details, SOAT information, payment records, and external data from RUNT (National Unified Transit Registry) and the company's ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system.
The project’s structure is organized around a robust data pipeline. Synthetic data, generated using Microsoft Presidio, simulates real-world scenarios, ensuring comprehensive testing and development. This data, in JSON, CSV, and SQL Server table formats, is ingested into Azure Blob Storage and subsequently into Azure Synapse Analytics via Synapse Pipelines.
Data transformation is a crucial step, involving data quality checks, CDC (Change Data Capture) Type 2 implementation for patient and accident data, and SOAT validity assessments. RUNT API integration (if available) enables the validation of vehicle and driver information, ensuring data accuracy. Delta Lake tables within Azure Synapse serve as the central data warehouse, designed using a star schema to optimize query performance and reporting.
Power BI is employed to visualize and analyze the processed data, creating 17 interactive dashboards and reports. These dashboards provide insights into accident frequency, severity, payment tracking, patient medical history, vehicle correlations, driver risk, and operational costs. Machine learning models, developed using Azure Machine Learning, predict accident risk for drivers, enabling proactive interventions and risk mitigation.

Workflows and Relations:

The project encompasses several interconnected workflows, each playing a vital role in the overall process:
1.	Data Ingestion Workflow: Ingests raw data from various sources (JSON, CSV, SQL Server) into Azure Synapse, logging FTP connections for CSV file transfers.
2.	Data Transformation Workflow: Cleanses, transforms, and enriches the ingested data, implementing CDC Type 2, SOAT validity checks, and RUNT API integration.
3.	Data Warehousing Workflow: Organizes the transformed data into Delta Lake tables, designed for efficient reporting and analysis.
4.	Reporting and Visualization Workflow: Creates interactive dashboards and reports in Power BI, providing actionable insights to stakeholders.
5.	Machine Learning Workflow: Develops and deploys machine learning models for accident risk prediction, integrated into the data pipeline.
6.	ERP Integration Workflow: Connects to the company's ERP system to incorporate cost data into the analysis.
7.	RUNT API Integration Workflow: Validates vehicle and driver data using the RUNT API, enhancing data accuracy.
These workflows are interconnected, with data flowing seamlessly from ingestion to reporting and analysis. Delta Lake tables act as the central repository, ensuring data consistency and accessibility across all workflows.

Alright, let's craft a comprehensive Azure-based data engineering project for healthcare insurance, focusing on accident analysis and SOAT (Obligatory Traffic Accident Insurance) in the Antioquia Department, Colombia. This project will leverage Microsoft Presidio for data generation, Azure Synapse for data warehousing and processing, and Power BI for reporting.
